            <p className='acercaTexts'>Detroit Classic Gallery (DCG) is a project shaped by a deep connection to electronic music and the lasting impact of Detroit techno. Founded by Juan Ignacio Chiri and Guido Sartoris, the duo behind E110101, DCG bridges music, design, and craftsmanship to create something authentic and personal.</p>
            <p className='acercaTexts'>What started as a platform to share their musical roots has grown into a space where creativity takes many forms—releases, events, and unique merchandise—all driven by a shared passion for detail and quality. At its core, DCG is about preserving the essence of electronic music while exploring new ways to express it.</p>
